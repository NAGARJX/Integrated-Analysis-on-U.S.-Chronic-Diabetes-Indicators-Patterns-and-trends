# Results and Insights


**Prevalence of Diabetes**

- The dashboard highlights the increasing trend of diabetes over the years.
- Specific age groups and regions with higher prevalence are identified.
**Demographic Insights**

  
- Gender-wise analysis shows a higher prevalence of diabetes among males/females (depending on data).
- Age-wise distribution indicates higher risk in older age groups.

  
# Future Work

The following areas are suggested for future enhancement:

- **Incorporating More Data Sources**: Adding more datasets to provide a comprehensive view.
- **Predictive Analytics**: Implementing machine learning models to predict future trends.
-**Real-Time Data Updates**: Integrating with real-time data sources for up-to-date insights.
-**User Feedback Integration**: Collecting and incorporating user feedback to improve the dashboardâ€™s usability and accuracy.
