A Comprehensive dataset for predicting Diabetes with Medical & Demographic Data

**About Dataset**


The Diabetes prediction dataset is a collection of medical and demographic data from patients, along with their diabetes status (positive or negative). The data includes features such as age, gender, body mass index (BMI), hypertension, heart disease, smoking history, HbA1c level, and blood glucose level. 

This dataset can be used to predict diabetes in patients based on their medical history and demographic information. This can be useful for healthcare professionals in identifying patients who may be at risk of developing diabetes and in developing personalized treatment plans. 

Additionally, the dataset can be used by researchers to explore the relationships between various medical and demographic factors and the likelihood of developing diabetes.

**Assessments**


- Retrieve the Patient_id and ages of all patients.
- Select all female patients who are older than 40.
- Calculate the average BMI of patients.
- List patients in descending order of blood glucose levels.
- Find patients who have hypertension and diabetes.
- Determine the number of patients with heart disease.
- Group patients by smoking history and count how many smokers and nonï¿½smokers there are.
- Retrieve the Patient_ids of patients who have a BMI greater than the average BMI.
- Find the patient with the highest HbA1c level and the patient with the lowest HbA1clevel.
- Calculate the age of patients in years (assuming the current date as of now).
- Rank patients by blood glucose level within each gender group.
- Update the smoking history of patients who are older than 50 to "Ex-smoker."
- Insert a new patient into the database with sample data.
- Delete all patients with heart disease from the database.
- Find patients who have hypertension but not diabetes using the EXCEPT operator.
- Define a unique constraint on the "patient_id" column to ensure its values are unique.
- Create a view that displays the Patient_ids, ages, and BMI of patients.
